This program was made on <u>January 8th, 2022</u>.

<b>WHY MAKE THIS PROGRAM WHEN THERE'S SEVERAL OTHERS OUT THERE?</b>
</br>
It was made in order to remind myself how to program in Python. Is this program
scuff? <u>YES!</u> Is this program optimized? <u>NO!</u> Is there much more I
could do in order to improve my programming skills based off of what I made in
this program? <b><u>ABSOLUTELY!</u></b>
